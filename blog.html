                <h2><i>Why do I enjoy working in front-end development?</i></h2>
                <p>I once read that front-end development is akin to learning to play the guitar in that it is simple to learn but difficult to master. Front-end is an important and unavoidable element of my existence for me. It's about the interesting sensation I get on a daily basis when I have to utilize my ingenuity, my aesthetic ability to handle front-end challenges. Therefore, although I get home fatigued but with a huge smile on my face after a long day at work. When you begin to perceive the world around you as a collection of forms and consider how you would code them, you realize that front-end development has become more than a job for you.</p>

                <h2><i>Should You Learn JavaScript? Advice for Newbie Web Developers</i></h2>
                <p>You may be asking what programming languages to learn if you want to work as a web developer. Not only that, but you'll want to know which languages to prioritize. Do you begin with the simplest? Or the ones that are the most useful? Both? Why study JavaScript these days, when there are so many options?</p>

                    JavaScript is beginner-friendly
                    Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about it is that it comes installed on every modern web browser—there’s no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!

                    Another advantage of learning JavaScript as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of code, you’ll immediately see visible results. There’s also a huge JS community on sites like Stack Overflow, so you’ll find plenty of support as you learn.

                    It is not just beginner-friendly, but it will also provide you with some incredibly transferrable abilities. Object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles are supported by JavaScript—skills that may be transferred to any other language you learn later, such as Python, Java, or C++. JavaScript gives you a solid foundation in exciting development techniques and methods that you'll use throughout your career.
